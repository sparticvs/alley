OpenSource Vagrant Cloud-like Service in Node.JS

Why alley?
-----------
Alley was created so that teams that you can host your Vagrant boxes from your
own servers for your own purposes. It uses the same API that the vagrant cli
program requires for Vagrant Cloud (Atlas) so you can use an unmodified vagrant
program to access the system.
